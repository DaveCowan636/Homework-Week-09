<p>Mario A. Segale is an American businessman and real estate developer. He has been involved in various development projects in the Seattle area since the 1950s. Nintendo's Mario character is named after him.</p>
</br>
<strong>Mario's Early Years (1981-1989)</strong>
We see our first signs of Mario's graphical development from Jump Man in Donkey Kong, to the more detailed sprites of Mario on the NES, which overall due to higher resolution capability gave Nintendo the capacity to enhance Mario's sprite.</br>
<strong>Mario Bros (1983)</strong></br>
This was an arcade style game, you could either play 1v1 battle mode vs. your brother Luigi. Or you could play on a multi-height level, with 2 pipes at the top, where a unlimited amount of turtles and other assorted enemies would descend upon you, the aim was to get the highest score (by killing more and more enemies). This was the first game in which Mario was a Plumber and saw the introduction of his brother, Luigi.
2 years after Mario Bros came Super Mario Bros which was the first visit to the Mushroom Kingdom, where Mario had gone to rescue a princess in distress, who had been kidnapped by Bowser.</br>
<strong>Super Mario Bros 2 (1988)</strong></br>
This was not originally a Mario game, it was once called Doki Doki Panic, all Nintendo did was simply replace the four players from Doki Doki Panic and insert the Super Mario Bros and their buddies Toad and Princess as playable characters.. Simple as that, this was the only game to feature Wart as the main boss. Mario uses vegetables and potions to defeat his foes in this game as opposed to the classic mushrooms and fire-flowers etc. You had the option to play as Princess Toadstool, Toad and Luigi too.</br>
<strong>Super Mario Bros 3 (1989)</strong></br>
Another of the Princess Toadstool rescuing platformers, this one however outsold any platform game in the world, even Super Mario World (Which imo is better). You play Mario (or Mario & Luigi in 2 player) trying to track down Bowser, you must also return the Wands of Power that control each lands to there Kings by defeating the Koopa Kids.</br>
<strong>Mario gains Super Power (1991-1993)</strong></br>
With the release of the SNES, a significantly more powerful platform than the NES in all respects, Mario's creators could finally make the colourful, more detailed sprites that we all know and love today.</br>
<strong>Super Mario World (1991)</strong></br>
<strong>Super Mario Kart (1992)</strong></br>
<strong>Super Mario RPG (1996)</strong></br>
Not only did Mario seem to lose a little weight for this title, but he also gained another dimension, breaking away from the typical 2D Mario Side-Scroller, Nintendo, partnered with SquareSoft, made a whole host of new characters, a whole lot of new sprites, and the biggest Mario storyline yet, in the first of the Mario RPG Games. This game was never released in Europe.</br>
<strong>Modern Incarnations Of Mario</strong></br>
The period of time between 2006 to the present day has been filled with a variety of brand new Mario games. In New Super Mario Bros, Bowser Jr. returns again to kidnap Peach and lead Mario on a quest through eight worlds in the Mushroom Kingdom. This game was an incredible homage to the Super Nintendo version of Mario, blending old and new styles to produce a great title in its own right.</br>
<strong> And Mario keeps going and going, with more titles being released all the time......</strong></br>
