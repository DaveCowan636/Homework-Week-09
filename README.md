# Homework-Week-09

I had some trouble with this weeks assignment, some personal issues happened and it got me behind
whith what I was working on.  I started with a diffirent layout, i was happy with the direction it was
going but couldnt get the final tweaks I needed to get the page to look right.  I uploaded what I did first
as Homework-Week-09-1, then I started over and redesigned the page using the duckett book as a refrence.
Even doing the code word for word in the examples I was getting diffirent results then what was shown in the book.
I was able to get most of it to layout the way I wanted, but could not get menu to set as a drop down 
box like I did on the first attempt.  Although on the first attempt it would still show it as a list but
would highlight in diffirent colors the choice selected when hovered over.  Already being quite late 
with this assignment I figured I would show what I had achived and move onto the next one.
The Colors I used were in colilation to the colors in the games. I thougt they accented the text and
images well.
